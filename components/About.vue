          <p>With so much information being published around every day, we just do not know what to trust. Coupled with this is the rise of Misinformation (Fake News). In the recent years, ‘Fact Checking’ has emerged as a powerful solution to the Misinformation problem. But the existing publishing platforms do not enable seamless publishing of fact-check stories that comply with the best practices of the ‘fact-checking’ ecosystem. The upside is that there is no problem that doesn’t have a solution.</p><br>
          <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold">
            Dega is the answer!
          </p><br>
          <p> Dega is an open source publishing platform that integrates all the best practices of the ‘fact-checking’ ecosystem as mandated by the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN) Code of principles. It enables you to seamlessly publish fact-check stories like any other. The ‘Claim Review’ schema is integrated into the platform and you do not have to do any extra work.</p><br>

        <p class="has-text-left">
          Now, we have different checks that a fact checked article has to go through. Dega just brings all of those standards together so you don’t have to go to waste time in manually checking for them or going to different places for enforcing these standards including the ‘Claim Review’ schema.
        </p><br>
        <p class="has-text-left">
          When you publish a fact-check article on Dega, the output is complaint with the ‘Claim Review’ schema as well as the standards of the IFCN.
